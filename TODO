* Make `coords` and `attrs` persistent across slicing operations 
  (try `df['pop'].to_xarray()` from above example and watch it 
  fail...)
* Improve hooks between `pandas` and `metacsv`:
  - update `coord` names on `df.index.names` assignment
  - update `coords` on stack/unstack
  - update `coords` on 
* Handle attributes indexed by coord/variable names --> assign to 
  coord/variable-specific `attrs`
* Let's start an issue tracker and get rid of this section!
* Should we rethink "special attributes," e.g. coords? Maybe these should 
  have some special prefix like `_coords` when included in yaml headers to 
  avoid confusion with other generic attributes...
* Write tests
* Write documentation
