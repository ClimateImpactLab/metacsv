TODO
============

* Make ``coords`` and ``attrs`` persistent across slicing operations 
  (try ``df['pop'].to_xarray()`` from above example and watch it 
  fail...)

* Improve hooks between ``pandas`` and ``metacsv``:

  - update ``coord`` names on ``df.index.names`` assignment
  - update ``coords`` on stack/unstack
  - update ``coords`` on 

* Handle attributes indexed by coord/variable names --> assign to 
  coord/variable-specific ``attrs``

* Let's start an issue tracker and get rid of this section!

* Should we rethink "special attributes," e.g. coords? Maybe these should 
  have some special prefix like ``_coords`` when included in yaml headers to 
  avoid confusion with other generic attributes...

* Allow special attributes (``coords``, ``variables``) in ``read_csv`` call

* Allow external file headers

* Write tests

* Write documentation

* Maybe steal xarray's coordinate handling and save ourselves a whole lotta work?


Feature Requests
==================
* Create syntax for ``multi-csv`` --> ``Panel`` or combining using filename regex
* Eventually? allow for on-disk manipulation of many/large files with dask/xarray
* Eventually? add xml, SQL, other structured syntax language conversions
